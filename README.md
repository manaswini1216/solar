☀️ Solar Energy Forecasting
This project predicts solar energy generation based on historical weather data using machine learning techniques. Accurate solar forecasting helps optimize power grid performance, reduce reliance on non-renewables, and support sustainable energy planning.

🧠 Project Overview
The goal is to estimate future solar energy output (in kWh or watts) given inputs like:

Solar irradiance

Temperature

Humidity

Cloud cover

Wind speed

Time of day

The model learns from historical patterns to make short-term or long-term predictions.

🔢 Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Time series forecasting and regression modeling

Support for daily/hourly predictions

Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R² score

(Optional) Streamlit or dashboard interface for live forecasting
